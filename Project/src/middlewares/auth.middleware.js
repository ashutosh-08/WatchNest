// completion you want to go to next middleware you can go you want to go to route you can go.
// we have to refreshToken acess but remember we have passed the app.cookieParser which gives req to acess the cookie
//we have check the condition(?) acesstoken exist or not, but why not they exist if we have given them remeber the case when we give t
// them in mobile application so may be user sending us custom header
// jwt passes authrorization : Bearer AccessToken , so what we do we replace the Bearer keyword with an empty "" 
// so we get direct authorization : AccessToken
// so at this point we can get token from cookies or authorization,
// so verify the token
