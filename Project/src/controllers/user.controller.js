//STEPS REQUIRED TO MAKE A REGISTER PAGE
/*  1. get user details from frontend
    2. validation -not empty
    3. check if user is already exists:username , email
    4. check for images, check for avatar
    5. upload them to cloudinary, check avatar
    6. create user-object(because mongoDb is a no sql type where we have to make objects)
     create entry in db
    7. remove password and refresh token field from response
    8. check for user creation    
    9. return res

    all the users detail from frontend comes from req(it can also say extracting data from req come from body, form,json etc)*/


//STEPS REQUIRED TO MAKE LOGIN PAGE
/*  1. Take data from req.body
    2. check valiidation on email or username
    3. find the user in databse
    4. check password
    5. generate access and refresh token
    6.send them in cookie(we send secure cookies which stored in client's browser)
    7. send the response.*/
